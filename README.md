- Option for logout for both Users and Admin.

- if you want to login as admin use vaibhavagarwal693@gmail.com as email and vaibhav321 as password . I aslo created register page for admin but then i thought it wont make sense as any one can register as admin so thats why im not using admin register page.


## NON-IMPLEMENTED / PLANNED FEATURES

- There is no option for admin and poc to see whoever has applied to that company although backend is ready but not able to integrate it.
- There is no option for users to upload resume.(will add in future).
- In company branch requirement I'm assuming only one branch and also only one role.

## LIST OF BUGS

- Page needs to refreshed after both user and admin login otherwise it wont work properly.
