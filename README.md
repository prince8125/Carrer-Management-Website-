# LIST OF IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

- Option for admin to delete the company
- Option for admin to view his profile page
- Option for new users to register
- Authentication of users during login
- All companies with status active visible to users .

- Option for Users to see applied companies
- Options for Users to see profile page.
- Option for POC to update details of company for which he is assigned POC.
- Option for logout for both Users and Admin.

- if you want to login as admin use vaibhavagarwal693@gmail.com as email and vaibhav321 as password . I aslo created register page for admin but then i thought it wont make sense as any one can register as admin so thats why im not using admin register page.


## NON-IMPLEMENTED / PLANNED FEATURES

- There is no option for admin and poc to see whoever has applied to that company although backend is ready but not able to integrate it.
- There is no option for users to upload resume.(will add in future).
- In company branch requirement I'm assuming only one branch and also only one role.

## LIST OF BUGS

- Page needs to refreshed after both user and admin login otherwise it wont work properly.
